It took me almost two hours to debug the program. At last I found the mistake in the brackets of the program.

if(file=open(path,1)<0)

In the above, since "=" has lower precedence than "<" and open returns a small positive integer,
the expression was being evaluated to 0 ie file=0(stdin) !!!!!!

The fix simply for the code was:

if( (file=open(path,1)) <0)

A big slow clap for me :P

I also do not know why the program is giving stray characters :
